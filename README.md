# all_paths_lead_to_rome
A 2D-3D platformer about outrunning your death. Sell your valuables and get a chance at erasing your failures!

Dual submission to Brackey's Game Jam 2025.1 and Godot Wild Jam #78.

Themes
For Brackey's Jam we get "Nothing can go wrong...", and following that, from Godot Wild we get "Erase" with the added bonus of "Style Shift" and "Shopaholic".

The result is a "choices-matter" 3D platformer with a mix of orthogonal 2D side-view and in-perspective 3D from-above-and-slightly-back, where you'll have to outrun a literal wall of death. Should you fail, you'll be able to exchange your valuables for another chance at life. Erase your mistakes and even forge new paths!

"choices-matter" meaning you only get one chance to complete the level without dying.

Controls
2D Side View:

WASD to go left to right (AD), and enter doors (W)

Space to jump

3D From Above And Slightly Back:

WASD to go forward, left, back and right

Space to jump

Consumables
Upon death you'll be greeted with an oportunity. Exchange your coin for a means to keep living. You can buy three items:

Purple Jewel: Let's you erase your most recent death, and retry a level.
Blue Jewel: Let's you erase and rewrite history, by letting you choose to start in any of your previously traversed levels.
Gold Jewel: Let's you erase time and space, to lower the speed at which the level moves.
